                <p>Chelsea have agreed a deal to sign midfielder Lesley Ugochukwu from Rennes for €27m (£23.1m).</p>
                <p>The Blues are yet to decide whether the 19-year-old will go into Mauricio Pochettino's first-team squad or go out on loan.</p>
                <p>A temporary move to Strasbourg, the Ligue 1 side in which Chelsea own a majority stake, has been mooted.</p>
                <p>Ugochukwu came through the academy at Rennes and has gone on to make 60 appearances for the club, including 35 in all competitions last season.</p>
