                <h5 class ='card-title'>Rasmus Hojlund: Manchester United agree £72m deal with Atalanta for Denmark forward</h5>
                <p class ='card-text'>Manchester United have reached an agreement with Serie A side Atalanta over the signing of striker Rasmus Hojlund; 20-year-old was left out of the squad that played Bournemouth in a pre-season friendly on Saturday</p>
                <p>Manchester United have agreed a deal to sign Atalanta's 20-year-old Danish international striker Rasmus Hojlund, according to reports. Manager Erik ten Hag has been on the hunt for a new striker since the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo last year, and loan replacement Wout Weghorst was let go at the end of an unimpressive spell at the end of the season.</p>
                <p>Manchester United have agreed a deal worth €75m million plus €10m add-ons for Rasmus Hojlund from Atalanta, according to reports.</p>
                <p>United have been chasing the 20-year-old for much of last season with reports suggesting that personal terms with Hojlund were agreed weeks ago.</p>
                <p>News on Saturday evening claims that United have agreed the outline of a deal with the Serie A side, that includes a guaranteed €75m, plus another €10m potentially available in add-ons.</p>

                <p>Atalanta had rejected previous proposals from United, some of which included the offer of players such as Fred and Donny van de Beek, both of whom are expected to leave Old Trafford this summer.</p>
                <p>United had also been linked to striker Harry Kane, but Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy is reluctant to sell to a Premier League rival and the England international appears close to a move to Bayern Munich instead.</p>
                <p>Hojlund is United's third signing of the summer. Mason Mount was bought from Chelsea for £55m, and Andre Onana has replaced David de Gea as the first-choice goalkeeper.</p>

                <p>United have been link with Zion Suzuki of Urawa Red Diamonds to be back-up goalkeeper should Dean Henderson move to Nottingham Forest, and Fiorentina's Sofyan Amrabat is reportedly a midfield target.</p>
                <p>Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay are also linked with moves away.</p>
