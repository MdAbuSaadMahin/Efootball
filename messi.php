                <p class ='card-text'>Lionel Messi followed-up his match-winning free kick with two more on Wednesday morning against Atlanta United in the Leagues Cup and showed how impactful a player he is.</p>
               
                
                <p>Messi scored twice and carved an assist in his first start for Miami, bringing his total to three goals in two games.</p>
                <p>Courtesy of the Argentine World Cup winner, Inter Miami had a 3-0 lead by halftime, the first such lead in club history.</p>
                <p>Miami went on to win 4-0. Messi exited in the 78th minute to a standing ovation, with many in the crowd wearing his No. 10 jersey.</p>
                <p>It all started in the eighth minute, when Messi took a pass from his longtime Barcelona teammate Sergio Busquets, surged forward and sent a strike off the right post before tapping in his own rebound.</p>
                <p>With Messi commanding much of the attention from Atlanta’s defenders, opportunities opened for other Miami players. Taylor scored in the 44th minute, then made it 4-0 in the 53rd after being set up by Messi.</p>
                <p>The fan sprinted all the way toward Miami’s bench wear Messi stood before Miami coach Tata Martino grabbed the attention of security. The fan was then escorted off the field.</p>
